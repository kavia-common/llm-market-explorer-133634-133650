## 1. Overview

LLM Market Explorer is a web-based application providing users with a comprehensive catalog of Large Language Models (LLMs) available on the market. The application enables users to browse, filter, and compare LLMs by features, usability, and cost. It is composed of two primary containers:

- A backend REST API (`llm_backend`, Node.js/Express)
- A frontend web application (`llm_frontend`, Angular)

The system emphasizes modular code structure, clean separation of concerns between backend and frontend, and ease of extensibility.

---

## 2. System and Component Architecture

The solution is divided into two main containers:

- **llm_backend** — Provides RESTful APIs for LLM catalog data, categories, and cost comparison.
- **llm_frontend** — Presents the data and visualization tools to end users, connecting to the backend over HTTP.

Both containers are independently deployable and scalable, with the frontend obtaining all LLM data via HTTP API requests to the backend.

---

## 3. Backend Architecture (llm_backend)

### Responsibilities

- Aggregate and manage the LLM catalog data, including periodic synchronization with validated sources.
- Organize LLMs by features, categories, and cost.
- Compute or normalize cost data for easy comparison.
- Expose all catalog, category, and comparison data through RESTful endpoints.
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for developers.
- Handle CORS, error recovery, and ensure high performance and stability.

### Key Modules

- **`src/app.js`**: Express application initialization, middleware setup (CORS, JSON parsing), API docs endpoint.
- **`src/server.js`**: Server bootstrapping, environmental configuration, and graceful shutdown.
- **`src/routes/`**: API route registration; currently includes health check and is designed for structured route expansion.
- **`src/controllers/`**: Handles API request lifecycles (future: LLM, category, cost controllers).
- **`src/services/`**: Business logic, data aggregation, health/baseline services.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger integration**: API contract for client consumption and future partner integrations.

### Interfaces

- REST endpoints over HTTP
- OpenAPI JSON available at `/docs`

---

## 4. Frontend Architecture (llm_frontend)

### Responsibilities

- Render a modern, responsive UI for LLM catalog exploration and comparison.
- Enable category/tag-based filtering, search and advanced comparison of LLMs.
- Display cost comparison in both tables and interactive charts.
- Provide detail pages for each LLM (feature breakdown, documentation links).
- Adhere to minimalistic, accessible, and device-responsive design guidelines.

### Key Modules

- **Angular Application Root** (`app/`)
  - **`app.component.ts/html/css`**: Root UI shell, initial title rendering (expandable to navigation and layout).
  - **`app.routes.ts`**: Defines navigation and future route structure.
  - **config files**: (`app.config.ts` and `app.config.server.ts`) — Bootstrapping options for client/server rendering.
  - **Styles and layouts**: Global minimalistic CSS for mobile and desktop, with strong emphasis on usability.
- **Support for SSR**
  - Server-side rendering (`main.server.ts`) for improved SEO and initial load performance.

### Interfaces

- User interacts only via the browser, which calls backend REST endpoints for all dynamic data.

---

## 5. Data Flow and Integration

### High-Level Flow

1. **Frontend** issues HTTP requests to **backend** for:
   - Full LLM catalog
   - Filtering/search (with query or filter params)
   - Category lists and model groupings
   - Model details and documentation links
   - Cost comparison data
2. **Backend** aggregates, normalizes, and serves these data via REST endpoints.
3. **Frontend**:
   - Renders lists, filters, charts, and detail views.
   - Receives updates when the underlying dataset on the backend changes (polling or architecture extension).
   
### Communication

- Backend and frontend communicate exclusively through RESTful API endpoints in JSON format.
- No direct database or file system access by the frontend.
- Example: `GET /llms`, `GET /llms/:id`, `GET /categories`, `GET /cost-comparison?...`

## 6. Major Modules and Components

### Backend (Modules/Components Overview)
- **API Layer**: Routing + controllers for catalog, category, and cost/comparison (with clear expansion points for future endpoints)
- **Business Logic Layer (Services)**: Feature and cost computation, data import/update, and error handling
- **Data Access Layer**: Adapters (future) for pulling from external validated data providers

### Frontend (Modules/Components Overview)
- **App Shell**: Header, navigation, main content area
- **Catalog List View**: Browsable/filterable list of LLMs
- **LLM Detail View**: Breakout details for each LLM
- **Comparison Tool**: Allows side-by-side comparison, renders both tables and charts
- **Global Components**: Search bar, filters, tag/category chips, responsive UI controls

## 7. Technology Stack and Frameworks

| Layer    | Technology         | Responsibilities                           |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Backend  | Node.js, Express  | Fast REST APIs, service aggregation, CORS  |
| Backend  | Swagger/OpenAPI   | API documentation and contract             |
| Backend  | (Planned)         | Data adapters for 3rd-party LLM providers  |
| Frontend | Angular           | UI framework, SPA structure, SSR           |
| Frontend | TypeScript        | Component and UI logic                     |
| Frontend | CSS (global)      | Minimalism, responsiveness                 |
| Shared   | REST/JSON         | Standardized API interface                 |

## 8. Container Responsibilities and Interfaces

### Backend (llm_backend)
- Serve as **single source of truth** for LLM data, categories, and cost comparison.
- Provide a discoverable, documented REST API.
- Enforce CORS and security best practices for data sharing.

### Frontend (llm_frontend)
- Visual display and interactivity for all LLM data, fetched in real-time from the backend.
- Provide search, filter, comparison, and detail views for the models.
- Responsive/adaptive layout suitable for business, technical, and decision-maker use.

---

## 9. Scalability, Responsiveness, and Extensibility

### Scalability

- Both containers can be independently scaled (e.g., in cloud environments or via containers/orchestrators).
- APIs are stateless; replica backends can be deployed for horizontal scale.

### Responsiveness

- Backend response times optimized via in-memory caching and efficient queries (future).
- Frontend delivers instantaneous UI updates using client-side filtering where possible, minimizing backend roundtrips.

### Extensibility

- **LLM/Feature Addition**: Adding a new field or LLM data source only requires backend service extension and will propagate to new frontend data displays.
- Modular codebase and routing design to streamline future module (e.g., authentication, provider integration) addition.
- OpenAPI documentation ensures new client integrations remain robust.

---

## 10. Key Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**: Full decoupling of backend (data/API) and frontend (presentation/UI) enables easier maintenance and future technology upgrades.
- **REST-First**: All data and user actions flow through REST endpoints, simplifying scaling and external integration.
- **Documentation-Driven API**: OpenAPI/Swagger is always available and updated with backend enhancements for easy developer onboarding.
- **Responsive/Accessible Design**: Frontend CSS and Angular structure ensure compliance with accessibility and usability standards.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Used on the frontend for faster initial load and SEO improvement.
- **Minimal Initial State**: Basic placeholder catalog and routes, with extension planned as more data and features are incorporated.
