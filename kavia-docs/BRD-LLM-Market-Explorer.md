## Project: LLM Market Explorer

---

## 1. Project Overview

LLM Market Explorer is an application designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of Large Language Models (LLMs) available in the market. The system displays LLMs, categorizes them by features and ease of use, and delivers cost comparisons to help stakeholders make informed choices. The application consists of two core components:
- **Backend API (llm_backend)**: Built with Express, it manages and serves data related to LLMs, their categories, and pricing information via RESTful APIs.
- **Frontend Web Application (llm_frontend)**: Developed using Angular, this provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring, filtering, and comparing LLMs.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

- To aggregate and present up-to-date information about a wide range of LLMs in the market.
- To enable users to compare LLMs based on features, ease of use, and pricing, facilitating informed decision-making.
- To deliver an intuitive and responsive web experience that encourages active exploration and comparison of LLM offerings.
- To cater to the needs of both business and technical stakeholders by providing actionable insights and visualizations.

## 3. Stakeholders and Their Needs

| Stakeholder Type          | Needs/Expectations                                                                            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Managers          | Quickly identify leading and upcoming LLMs, assess feature gaps, and evaluate cost benchmarks.|
| Developers                | Access detailed technical information about LLM APIs, libraries, and integration options.      |
| Business Analysts         | Conduct market research and comparative analysis for procurement and reporting.                |
| Technical Decision-makers | Make data-driven choices on which LLMs to adopt, based on holistic feature and cost profiles. |

## 4. Key Features

- **LLM Catalog Display**: Comprehensive, filterable list of currently available LLMs.
- **Categorization & Tagging**: Grouping of LLMs by features (e.g., context length, fine-tuning, cloud support) and ease of use (integration level, documentation quality).
- **Cost Comparison**: Tabular and graphical cost comparison of LLMs across plans or vendors.
- **Search & Filter**: Multi-faceted search and filtering (by feature, price range, vendor, model type, usability, etc.).
- **Responsive UI**: Adaptive design for seamless use across devices.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Charts and visual tools for clearer comparison.
- **Documentation & API Reference Links**: Easy access to relevant documentation for each LLM.
- **RESTful Backend API**: Clean separation of concerns for frontend and backend, allowing future integrations.

## 5. High-Level Business Workflows

### 5.1. LLM Exploration Workflow
1. **User accesses the web frontend.**
2. The application fetches the list of LLMs (and metadata) from the backend API.
3. User browses the catalog, using category filters or search features to narrow results.
4. User clicks on a model to view detailed feature breakdown, usage notes, and cost.
5. User toggles cost comparison tools for multiple models.

### 5.2. Data Management Workflow (Backend)
1. Catalog data is periodically updated or synchronized from validated sources.
2. The backend organizes LLMs by categories and computes cost data for comparison.
3. REST APIs expose consolidated and clean data to the frontend.

### 5.3. Comparative Analysis Workflow
1. User selects multiple LLMs for side-by-side comparison.
2. The frontend visualizes key differentiators (price, features, usability) in a tabular or chart-based format.
3. Data can be exported or linked to external resources for further analysis.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Responsiveness**: UI must render correctly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Usability**: Minimalistic, modern, and intuitively navigable interface, enabling rapid understanding and action for all user personas.
- **Performance**: API responses should be delivered with low latency. Frontend must provide instantaneous search/filtering via efficient data handling.
- **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**: Backend should gracefully handle data import errors or third-party source downtime without impacting API stability.
- **Maintainability**: Modular backend and frontend codebases with clear interface contracts and linting/testing enforced.
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with WCAG standards to ensure usability for users of all abilities.
- **Security**: Proper management of API access, CORS, and sensitive data (if applicable).

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- The application is able to display a minimum viable set of LLMs with accurate and up-to-date information covering feature sets and pricing.
- Users can filter, search, and compare LLMs seamlessly through the frontend interface.
- Cost comparison and feature visualization are provided in both tabular and chart form.
- All core workflows (catalog browsing, comparison, search/filter) perform reliably across common browsers and devices.
- Product managers, analysts, and developers report satisfaction regarding the completeness and actionable nature of the information presented.
- Backend and frontend are independently testable and documented.
- The UI is rated as easy to use and visually clear in feedback from at least three major stakeholder groups.

## 8. Glossary

- **LLM**: Large Language Model, a type of AI model specialized for natural language understanding and generation.
- **RESTful API**: A web service facilitating programmatic access to resources via HTTP protocols.
- **Cost Comparison**: Assessment of relative pricing among different LLMs, often considering usage tiers and value-added features.

---

## 9. Out of Scope

- Implementation of model inference or fine-tuning directly in the application.
- Real-time API integrations with all provider endpoints (unless explicitly documented).
- User account management or authentication features, unless introduced in future phases.
