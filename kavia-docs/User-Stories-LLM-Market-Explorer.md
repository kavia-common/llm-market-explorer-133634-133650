# Agile User Stories for LLM Market Explorer

This document translates the business requirements of the LLM Market Explorer into actionable Agile user stories, each accompanied by acceptance criteria and story point estimates.

## 1. User Story: Display LLM Catalog

**Title:** As a user, I want to see a comprehensive and filterable list of available LLMs so that I can explore market options.

**Description:** Users should be able to access a central catalog page listing all currently available LLMs, including summary data for each (name, provider, feature highlights, price snippet). The data should be fetched from the backend in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The frontend displays a list of LLMs fetched from the backend API.
- Each LLM entry includes name, provider, core features, and a cost summary.
- The catalog must load within 2 seconds in normal conditions.
- The list updates if the underlying data is refreshed.

**Story Points:** 3

## 2. User Story: Search and Filter LLMs

**Title:** As a user, I want to search and filter the LLM catalog by features, price, vendor, and other attributes so that I can quickly find relevant models.

**Description:** Users can apply search queries and filters (such as context length, price range, model vendor, model type, or integration level). Filter and search updates should be reflected instantly in the UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- There is a search bar and filter controls for the main LLM attributes.
- Applying filters/searches narrows the visible LLM list in real time.
- The system supports combined search and filter criteria.
- Users can clear filters and restore the full list.

## 3. User Story: Categorize and Tag LLMs

**Title:** As a user, I want LLMs to be grouped and tagged by features and usability metrics, making it easy to explore models by category.

**Description:** Each LLM should be assigned one or more tags that indicate available features (e.g., fine-tuning, cloud support) and ease of use (e.g., integration, documentation quality). Users can use category navigation to see groups of similar LLMs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Backend supports association of LLMs to multiple categories/tags.
- Frontend displays tags/badges and provides navigation by category.
- Selecting a category displays only LLMs from that category.
- Tags are visible on each LLM entry.

## 4. User Story: Cost Comparison Table and Visualization

**Title:** As a user, I want to compare the costs of different LLMs both in tables and via visual charts so that I can assess value and fit.

**Description:** Users should be able to choose multiple LLMs for comparative analysis, view cost breakdowns in tabular format, and visualize differences using graphs or charts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can select at least two LLMs for comparison.
- A comparison table displays detailed price/performance metrics per model.
- A chart or graph provides a visual breakdown of costs/features.
- Comparison tools update dynamically based on user selection.

**Story Points:** 8

## 5. User Story: LLM Detailed View

**Title:** As a user, I want to view detailed feature breakdown, usage notes, and direct links to documentation for each LLM.

**Description:** Clickable LLM entries open a dedicated page or modal, providing in-depth details (all features, supported languages, limits, usability notes), with direct access to external documentation or API guides.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each LLM entry is clickable and opens a details view.
- The details view presents all available metadata, tags, and documentation links.
- Documentation/API links open in a new tab.

## 6. User Story: Responsive and Usable UI

**Title:** As a user, I want the application interface to be visually clear, modern, and work smoothly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**Description:** The UI must be responsive and maintain a consistent, minimalistic, and accessible design across devices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The interface adapts fluidly to different browser sizes and orientations.
- All UI controls (search, filter, tables, charts) are easy to use on touch and mouse.
- The design follows WCAG accessibility standards.
- User tests confirm clarity and ease of use for all target user personas.

**Story Points:** 8

## 7. User Story: Backend Data Management

**Title:** As a backend admin, I want catalog data to be updated and synchronized from validated sources, keeping the displayed LLM information current.

**Description:** Automated or manual mechanisms should ensure that the backend database is refreshed with the latest LLM information, including features, categorization, and pricing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin tools or scripts support periodic updates of LLM data.
- Data import errors or third-party source downtime do not crash the API.
- Data refreshes propagate correctly to the frontend once available.

**Story Points:** 5

---

## 8. User Story: RESTful API Design

**Title:** As a developer, I want a clean and well-documented set of RESTful APIs for accessing LLM and comparison data.

**Description:** The backend should expose endpoints for catalog querying, filtering, fetching metadata, and cost data. API should be documented for easy future integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend exposes endpoints as defined in the OpenAPI specification.
- The API supports all queries required by the frontend.
- API documentation is available via a public route (e.g., /docs).
- Unit/integration tests cover major API paths.

**Story Points:** 5

## 9. User Story: Reliability, Security, and Accessibility

**Title:** As a product owner, I want the system to be reliable, secure, and accessible so that it performs well for all users and scenarios.

**Description:** The system should handle errors gracefully, protect API endpoints as needed (including CORS and sensitive data), and ensure people with disabilities can use the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Backend gracefully handles and reports errors.
- CORS is properly configured to allow only intended domains.
- The application passes basic accessibility audits.
- Security best practices are documented and followed.

**Story Points:** 5

## 10. User Story: Export or Link Comparative Data

**Title:** As a user, I want to export the comparison results or link to external resources for further analysis.

**Description:** After comparing LLMs, users should be able to export tables/charts or generate shareable links for further research or reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can export comparison results as CSV or image (for charts).
- Users can copy or share URLs linking to filtered or comparison views.
- Exported/downloaded data matches what is displayed on the screen.

**Story Points:** 3

## Estimation Notes

- **1 Point:** Minimal effort/basic UI only.
- **3 Points:** Straightforward UI or backend implementation.
- **5 Points:** Multiple components or integration, moderate complexity.
- **8 Points:** Complex workflows, significant UI/backend logic, or multiple integrations.
- **13+ Points:** Reserved for epic/scaffolding, not encountered in these user stories.
